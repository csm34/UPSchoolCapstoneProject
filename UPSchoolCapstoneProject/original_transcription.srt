00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
And at the end of the day, I was CEO of FTX. And that means whatever happened, whyever it happened,

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,760
I had a duty. I had a duty to all of our stakeholders, to our customers, our creditors.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,600
I had a duty to our employees, to our investors, and to the regulators of the world to do right

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,000
by them, to make sure the right things happened at the company. And clearly, I didn't do a good

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,120
job of that. Clearly, I made a lot of mistakes or things I wouldn't give anything to be able

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:37,439
to do over again. I didn't ever try to commit fraud on anyone. I was excited about the prospects

7
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:43,439
of FTX a month ago. I saw it as a thriving, growing business. I was shocked by what happened

8
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:50,799
this month. And reconstructing it, where there are things I wish I had done differently.
